My personal Opera and Chrome extensions. Only testing on Opera, but most should be able to be easly packed on Chrome as well.

svd_enabler just sets so svd.se can't set cokkies and thus circumventing the annoying block that shows up at times.

tab_actions tries to mimic the policy from old opera, open last tab opened from current tab upon close. Still a work in progress.

Known bugs: it reorders tabs slightly upon closing
